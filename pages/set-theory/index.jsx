       In mathematics, \t\t\t\t\ta set is defined as an \t\t\t**unordered collection of unique items**.
       This short yet concise definition contains everything needed to understand the essence of the object we call a 'mathematical set'.
       Let's analyze it more in depth:
       \n- **Unordered:** Two or more sets containing the same items are identical.
       \n- **Collection:** Stands for zero or more items (up to an infinite number).\n- **Unique:** Each member of the set is distinct, and no two or more identical items are present.\n
       What kinds of items or entities could be members of a mathematical set?
       \nWhatever it is, it doesn't matter.Mathematics is all about abstraction. In the abstract world, things can be of any type, so the famous 'apples and oranges' problem doesn't apply here. These entities can live together being a parts of the same set.\n

         **Notations For Mathematical Sets**
         It is a widespread convention to denote mathematical sets by capital English letters (for instance A,B,C ).
         Although there are no strict rules here, following the convention helps maintain standards and communication in the academic world.
         \n- **Enumerative Set Notation**
         This method is pretty straightforward and ,actually, involves listing the elements of a set within curly braces.
         There is several ways to describe mathematical sets using enumerative notation.
         **Listing all elements of a set within curly braces:**
         $ùê¥$ ={1,2,3}
         $B$ ={a,b,c,d}(Not only numbers are allowed)
         $C$ ={1,a,30,'cfgd',œÄ}(Reminds you that set can have items of different types )
         $D$ ={23,a,üòä,œÄ,A,üî∫,'hello',œà}(Mathematical set can include practically anything)
         $E$ ={ }(Empty set)
          **Listing elements we can list and then using ellipsis (...) which stands for the omitted items:**
          $ùê¥$ ={1,2,3...}
          $B$ ={a,b,c,d...}
          $C$ ={1,a,b,4,7,...}
          We will discuss later in which cases it may be useful but just for the moment let's just be content with those examples.
       \n- **Descriptive Set Notation:**
        It defines a set by specifying a property that its elements must satisfy and is particularly useful when enumerative notation would not work because the sets are too large or it is difficult to list the elements directly.
        For example, **the set of all positive even numbers can be expressed as:**
        $A$={x‚à£x¬†is¬†a¬†positive¬†even¬†number}, where \( \mid \) means "such that." This notation is useful for representing large or infinite sets without listing all elements explicitly.
        You can think of descriptive set notation as comprising four main parts or building blocks:
        **1.Variable (Element of the Set)**
         *May be denoted by symbols (x, y ,z)
         *Or simply by words ({number | number is a positive even number},{prime number | prime number > 10})
        **2.Vertical Bar (|)**
        Represent the phrase "such that" widely used in mathematics (or ,in another words, "where", "for which").
        Always comes between the variable and the following condition.
        **3.Condition/s (Property/s or Rule/s)**
        Defines which elements belong to the set.Must be present and have to be clear, precise and can not include logical contradictions.
        Similar to variables , may be expressed with mathematical symbols (x > 0 or 0 ‚â§ y ‚â§ 3) or with words (x is divisible by 2 , for example).
        **4.Curly Braces ({})**
        Enclose the entire set notation, indicating that the expression inside defines a set.
        Turns all we described above into formal mathematical expression.\n
       **More Basic Notations used in Set Theory**
        \n- **Empty Set (‚àÖ or {}):**
         Represents a mathemathical set which contains no elements.
         \n- **Belongs to (‚àà):**
         x‚ààA means that x is an element of set ùê¥.
         \n- **Does not belong to (‚àâ): **
         y‚àâB means that ùë¶  is not an element of set ùêµ.\n

       **Some Notations used for Concepts We did not discuss yet**
        \n- **Subset (‚äÜ) **
        \n- **Proper Subset (‚äÇ) **
        \n- **Superset (‚äá) **
        \n- **Proper Superset (‚äÉ) **
        
        We will discuss those and other concepts later on this page .

         "content": `
         **Cardinality** of a mathematical set is simply its size, just the number of elements in the set.
         Cardinality is often denoted by the symbol |ùê¥‚à£ or card (ùê¥), where ùê¥ is the set.
        Sometimes symbols like #ùê¥,n(ùê¥), or ‚à•ùê¥‚à• may be used as well.
         If ùê¥ = {1, 2, 3}, then the cardinality of A is |ùê¥| = 3 because there are three elements in the set.
         If B = {1, 'apple', 3.14, True}, then the cardinality of B is |B| = 4 because there are four elements in this set.
        
        Based on cardinality, mathematical sets in set theory are classified into groups:
        \n- **Finite sets**
         Sets having well-defined numbers of elements that may be expressed by natural numbers (positive integers).
         Examples:
         ùê¥ = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
         B = {1, 'apple', 3.14, True}
        The set may contain millions of objects, but as long as it can be counted theoretically, this set is finite.
        \n- **Infinite sets**
        Sets that include an uncountable number of elements.
         Examples:
         A={x‚à£x is a positive even number}.Impossible to count all positive even numbers
         B={1,2,3...}. 
         \n- **Empty set**
         A special case of a finite mathematical set having no elements.
         Notations used for empty set :
         $E$ ={ } or $E$ =‚àÖ
        \n- **Universal set**
        A mathematical set that contains all the objects or elements under consideration ¬†
        within a specific context or domain of discourse. 
        The universal set may be **finite**, like in those examples:
        Days of the Week. If the universal set represents the days of the week, then U = {Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,..., Sunday}. 
        This set is finite, having 7 elements.
        
        Examples of infinite universal sets:
        Natural Numbers. If the universal set represents all natural numbers, then U = {1, 2, 3,...}. This set is infinite.
        Real Numbers. If the universal set represents all real numbers, U = R. This set is infinite, containing an uncountable number of elements.
         **The universal set is typically denoted by U or Œæ.**\n
         Interestingly, despite being conceptually opposite, the universal set and the empty set share fundamental commonalities in set theory. 
         Both are extremes in the hierarchy of sets, with the universal set containing everything and the empty set containing nothing. 
         Yet they are complementary and serve as identity elements in key set operations.
        We will discuss this relation in more detail in later sections.
         Understanding the concept of the universal set, along with the empty set, has immense importance for mastering other ideas in 
        set theory, such as operations on sets, relations, and more.¬†

         **Basic Set Membership**
       \n- **Belongs to ( ‚àà )**
         Object belongs to a set if it is an element of the set.
         Notation: x ‚àà A means that x is an element of set A.
         Example: If A = {1, 2, 3}, then 1 ‚àà A but 4 ‚àâ A.
       \n- **Does not belong to ( ‚àâ )**
         Notation: y ‚àâ B means that y is not an element of set B.
         Example: If B = {5, 6, 7}, then 4 ‚àâ B.
        "${diagrams[1].svg}"
       **Diagram 2. Set Menbership.**


     **Equality and Inequality of Sets**
     \n- **Equality ( = )**: Two sets are equal if they contain exactly the same elements.
     Example: A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {3, 1, 2}; A = B.
     \n- **Inequality ( ‚â† )**: Two sets are unequal if there is at least one element that is different between the sets.
     Example: A = {1, 2, 3} and C = {4, 5, 6}; A ‚â† C.\n
     \n**Subsets**
       \n- **Basic Subsets**:
       A set is a subset of another set if every element of this set is also an element of the including set.
       Example:
         A = {1, 2} is a subset of B = {1, 2, 3, 4}.
       \n- **Proper Subsets**:
       A proper subset of a set is a subset that is not equal to the original set, containing fewer elements.
    Example:
    A = {1, 2} is a proper subset of B.\n
     **Supersets**
       \n- **Basic Supersets**:
       A superset includes every element of another set.
       Example:
       A = {1, 2, 3, 4} is a superset of B = {1, 2} and C={1, 2, 3, 4}.
       \n- **Proper Supersets**:
       A proper superset contains all elements of the subset plus additional elements.
       Example: 
       A is a proper superset of B but not a proper superset of C.

     **Disjoint Sets**
     Two sets are disjoint if they have no common elements.
     Example:
     A = {1, 2, 3} and C = {4, 5, 6} are disjoint.

     **Complement**
     The complement of set A with respect to a universal set U includes all elements that are in U but not in A.
     Example:
     U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; A = {1, 2, 3}; $A^c = {4, 5}$.

     This comprehensive section starts by establishing the fundamental notions of set membership, which is crucial for understanding all subsequent relationships and operations between sets. 
     This foundation is then expanded upon with various types of set relations, all illustrated with clear examples to enhance understanding.

        \n- **Intersection ( ‚à© )**
         The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted as A ‚à© B, is the set of elements that are common to both A and B.
         Example:
         If A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {3, 4, 5, 6}, then A ‚à© B = {3, 4}.

             \n- **Union ( ‚à™ )**
             The union of two sets A and B, denoted as A ‚à™ B, is the set of elements that are in A, in B, or in both.
             Example:
             If A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {4, 5, 3}, then A ‚à™ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

             \n- **Difference ( - )**
             The difference between two sets A and B, denoted as A - B, is the set of elements that are in A but not in B.
             Example:
             If A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {3, 4, 5, 6}, then A - B = {1, 2}.

               \n- **Symmetric Difference ( Œî )**
               The symmetric difference between two sets A and B, denoted as A Œî B, is the set of elements
               that are in either of the sets A or B but not in their intersection.
               Example:
               If A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {3, 4, 5}, then A Œî B = {1, 2, 4, 5}.
