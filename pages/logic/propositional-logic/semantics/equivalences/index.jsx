    title: "Introduction to Logical Equivalences",
    content: `**Logical equivalences** are fundamental building blocks in propositional logic that help us understand when two different-looking statements actually mean the same thing. Two logical statements are **logically equivalent** if they always produce identical truth values, regardless of the truth values of their components.
   
   Understanding logical equivalences is crucial for simplifying complex logical expressions, constructing proofs, and analyzing logical arguments. This comprehensive guide explores multiple verification methods, from truth tables for small expressions to algebraic manipulation using established logical laws.
   
   We'll cover essential equivalences including **material implication** (transforming "if-then" statements), **De Morgan's laws** (handling negations of compound statements), and **biconditional equivalences** (understanding "if and only if" relationships). You'll also learn fundamental laws like the distributive, associative, and absorption laws that form the foundation of logical reasoning.
   
   Whether you're working with simple propositions or complex nested statements, mastering these equivalences will give you powerful tools for logical analysis, proof construction, and mathematical reasoning. Each equivalence comes with clear explanations and practical applications to help you understand not just **what** these relationships are, but **why** they work.`
   }

  const verify=[
    `**Truth Tables (Brute-Force Method)**:
Construct a truth table for both expressions.
Check if the final column values are identical for all possible truth values of the variables.
If they match in every row, the expressions are logically equivalent.
✅ Best for: Propositional logic with a small number of variables.
❌ Not practical for more than 3-4 variables due to exponential growth in rows.`,
`**Algebraic Manipulation Using Logical Laws**:
Apply known logical equivalences ([laws](!/logic/propositional-logic/laws)) (e.g., De Morgan’s laws, distributive, commutative, associative properties) to transform one statement into another.
If you can rewrite $𝑃$ into $𝑄$ (or vice versa), they are equivalent.
✅ Best for: Proofs and simplifying expressions without constructing tables.
❌ Requires familiarity with logical laws.`,
`**Using Logical Implications**:
Show that $𝑃→𝑄$ and $𝑄→𝑃$ are both true.
If both implications hold, then $𝑃≡𝑄$.
✅ Best for: When equivalences involve implications.
❌ Requires proving two separate implications.`,
`**Venn Diagrams (Set-Theoretic Approach)**:
Represent logical statements using sets and intersections/unions.
If two statements cover the same region, they are equivalent.
✅ Best for: Visualizing logical expressions.
❌ Not practical for complex expressions.`

    content:`## Definition
          Two logical statements (or propositions) are logically equivalent if they **always** have the same truth value, regardless of the truth values of their individual components. This means that no matter what, both expressions will evaluate to either true or false together in every possible case.
          
## Notation
          Logical equivalence is usually written as:   

\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t $P≡Q$
   Sometimes notation like this is used :

\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  $P⇔Q$

Both of those forms are legitimate and acceptable to notate equivalence.Both notations indicate that $𝑃$ and $𝑄$ always produce the same truth values.
In boolean algebra also used this notation:

\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  $P=Q$

The notations for logical equivalence and **biconditional** ($P↔Q$ or $𝑃⟺𝑄$) can sometimes look similar, but they have different meanings, and they are not always interchangeable.
$P≡Q$ means $𝑃$ and $𝑄$  are logically equivalent in all possible cases.
$𝑃↔𝑄$ is just a statement that says $𝑃$ and $𝑄$ happen to be true or false together in a specific context - it can be true or false, depending on $𝑃$ and $𝑄$.          `,

    On the other hand, many of logical equivalences, while being valid transformations, are not considered fundamental laws because they depend on definitions, are derived from the laws, or are specific to certain logical systems.

    after:`
All logical equivalences involving **implications** provide ways to rewrite conditional statements in different but logically identical forms. A common theme among them is restructuring the relationship between the antecedent ($𝑝$) and the consequent ($𝑞$) using negation, disjunction, or conjunction while preserving truth values. These transformations help simplify logical expressions and proofs.

  biconditional:{

    title:'Equivalences with Biconditionals',
    content:``,
    before:`Logical equivalences involving **biconditional statements** ($𝑝↔𝑞$) focus on expressing the mutual dependence of two propositions in different but logically equivalent ways. The biconditional means "p if and only if q," meaning both must have the same truth value (either both true or both false).
                Here are some equivalences involving **biconditional statements**:
                
                `,
    after:   `
     **Conclusion on Biconditional Equivalences**  
    Biconditional equivalences highlight the **fundamental symmetry** in logic: two statements are **logically interchangeable** if and only if they always have the same truth value. These equivalences allow us to express \( p \leftrightarrow q \) in different but logically equivalent ways, making it easier to manipulate and analyze logical statements.  
        - **They break down into implications**, showing that mutual implication defines equivalence.  
        - **They connect to conjunction and disjunction**, emphasizing that two statements are equivalent when they share truth values.  
        - **Negating a biconditional results in an XOR**, reinforcing that logical opposition emerges when one statement is true and the other is false.  
    
    In formal logic, these properties make biconditionals a powerful tool for **proofs, simplifications, and logical reasoning** across mathematics, philosophy, and computing.`,
