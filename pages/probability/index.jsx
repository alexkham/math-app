        description:`@academic[theorem: The Sample Space (Œ©), is the collection of all different results that the experiment may produce.]@
        The sample space can be **finite** (for example, in the die‚Äêrolling scenario or coin flipping) or **infinite** (for instance, selecting a real number).
         Although in the case of a die roll the collection of possible outcomes may seem self‚Äêevident, the sample space plays an important role in conducting more complex experiments. Typically, a researcher will take the sample space and partition it into subsets in order to draw various conclusions.
         @academic[theorem:Probability Event is simply any subset of the sample space.]@
         **Example:**
   In case of die roll the sample space would be S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
   **Some possible events:**
 Event A = {2, 4, 6} (rolling an even number)
 Event B = {5} (rolling exactly 5)
 Event C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} (any outcome - certain event)
 Event D = {} (impossible event)
 As the definition states and the example shows, probability event may include one or more outcomes.It is a set of results counting as one event.         
 @academic[theorem:Probability is a function that assigns to each event in the sample space a real number in $[0,1]$ where total probability value of the entire sample space $ùëÉ(ùëÜ)=1$.]@
 @academic[theorem:This number is calculated as a ratio $P(E) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes for event E}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes in the sample space S}}$]@

It extends to advanced topics like statistical measures (E(X), Var(X)), hypothesis testing parameters (H‚ÇÄ, Œ±, p-value), and information theory metrics (H(X), I(X;Y)).
Specialized sections cover moment generating functions (M_X(t)), key probability inequalities (Markov's, Chebyshev's), Bayesian methods, and regression analysis notation‚Äîall presented with precise LaTeX formatting to support academic writing and research in probability and statistics.`,

    title: "Introduction to Probability Section",
    content: `**Probability** is a field of mathematics that deals with  **uncertainty** and provides tools to measure and analyze how likely events are to occur. It begins with basic concepts such as outcomes, events, and sample spaces, forming the foundation for calculating likelihoods.
Central to probability is the concept of **probability measures**, which assign values between 0 and 1 to **events**, indicating their **likelihood**. A value of 0 means an event is impossible, while 1 signifies certainty. Key principles include **independence** (events that do not influence each other) and **conditional probability**, which considers the likelihood of an event given that another has occurred.
Probability also introduces **random variables**, which assign numerical values to outcomes. These variables are categorized as either **discrete** (taking specific values, like rolling a die) or **continuous**(taking any value within a range, like measuring temperature). Important measures such as **expectancy(average value)** and **variance(spread or variability)** are used to summarize the behavior of **random variables**.
Advanced topics include **distributions**, such as the **binomial**, **normal**, and **Poisson distributions**, which model specific types of random phenomena. These tools are essential for understanding patterns in **random processes** and making informed predictions.
Probability is widely applied in science, engineering, finance, and everyday decision-making. It forms the basis for statistics, enabling data-driven insights and predictions, and supports fields like machine learning, risk analysis, and quantum mechanics. By studying probability, students develop skills to reason about uncertainty and draw conclusions from incomplete information.`
