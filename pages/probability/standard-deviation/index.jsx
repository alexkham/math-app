            **Defining the Concepts**:
            - **Variance**: Defined as the average of the squared differences from the Mean.
            - **Standard Deviation**: Described as the square root of variance, useful for describing dispersion in the same units as the data.
            **Relationship and Differences**: Elaborate on how both measures are calculated and used, and why standard deviation is often preferred for practical data analysis.

            - **Population Standard Deviation**: \( \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (X_i - \mu)^2}{N}} \)
